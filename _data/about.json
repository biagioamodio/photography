  "content": "Ciao! I'm an italian photographer based in London.\n\nI feel there’s an invisible reality hiding behind the one I see with my eyes. It speaks a forgotten language and moves at a different speed.\n\nWith my work, I seek to get in touch with that realm and my camera becomes a tool for meditation, while developing the negatives is a sacred ceremony, a way to be present, to slow down and witness beauty unfold.\n\nEach photograph is an attempt to hold onto something intangible, a glimpse of my inner world reflected in the mirror of the material one.",
