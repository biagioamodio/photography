  "content": "Ciao! I'm Biagio, an italian photographer based in London.\n\nI do things, I see people and I bring with my camera along. Makes me see more of the world.\n\nI like to tell stories of people and places capturing the light they reflect, give my film rolls a chemical bath and let beauty unfold before scanning the negatives. It has all the elements of a sacred ceremony.\n\nI find interesting how we can relate to something we’ve never seen, heard of known, because it speaks a universal language that somehow we all understand.",
